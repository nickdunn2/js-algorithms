/**
 * You are a renowned thief who has recently switched from stealing precious metals to stealing cakes,
 * because of the insane profit margins. You end up hitting the jackpot,
 * breaking into the world's largest privately owned stock of cakesâ€”the vault of the Queen of England.
 *
 * While Queen Elizabeth has a limited number of types of cake, she has an unlimited supply of each type.
 *
 * Each type of cake has a weight and a value, stored in an object with two properties:
 *
 * weight: the weight of the cake in kilograms
 * value: the monetary value of the cake in British shillings
 *
 * e.g., { weight: 7, value: 160 } // Weighs 7 kilograms and has a value of 160 shillings
 *
 * You brought a duffel bag that can hold limited weight, and you want to make off with the most valuable haul possible.
 *
 * Write a function maxDuffelBagValue() that takes an array of cake type objects and a weight capacity,
 * and returns the maximum monetary value the duffel bag can hold.
